Paul Hudson's ([@twostraws](https://x.com/twostraws)) 100 Days of Swift UI Project 11.

## Project 11

Source URL: [Bookworm: Introduction](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bookworm-introduction)

"In this project we’re going to build an app to track which books you’ve read and what you thought of them, and it’s going to follow a similar theme to project 10: let’s take all the skills you’ve already mastered, then add some bonus new skills that take them all to a new level.

This time you’re going to meet `SwiftData`, which is Apple’s framework for working with databases. This project will serve as an introduction for `SwiftData`, but we’ll be going into much more detail soon.

At the same time, we’re also going to build our first custom user interface component – a star rating widget where the user can tap to leave a score for each book. This will mean introducing you to another property wrapper, called `@Binding` – trust me, it will all make sense."

### Challenge 1

Branch: `challenge-1`

Right now it’s possible to select no title, author, or genre for books, which causes a problem for the detail view. Please fix this, either by forcing defaults, validating the form, or showing a default picture for unknown genres – you can choose.
